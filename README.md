My name is Allison and I'm currently pursuing a career in software development.
I'm about 8(ish) months into studying, and I'm still uncertain of whether or not I'm more
interested in client-side or server-side development. I feel moderatly comfortable with
vanilla CSS and JavaScript. I'll be starting the Tech Elevator program on 13 May,
and I'm very excited to begin learning Java, SQL, and especially how to write/build APIs.
The most enjoyable part of programming for me is building my own small toy projects.
I've learned a lot by simply reading other people's code, and running through the chrome
devtools debugger to see how the code is executed in the callstack. However, I'm highly insecure
about the code I write and I fear that I've learned some bad practices, so I'm looking forward to
being in an in-person classroom environment, where I can receive direct feedback on the work
I'm doing.

Fun facts about me: I lived in South Korea for 4.5 years, I've visited over 20 countries,
I love painting and reading, and I LOVE trying new things :).
